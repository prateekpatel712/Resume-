# HTML Resume

This project is a simple **HTML resume** created to demonstrate proper use of **semantic HTML5**. The focus is on clean structure, readability, and correct tag usage rather than styling or frameworks.

## Setup

1. Clone or download the repository to your local system.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
3. Locate the file **`resume.html`** in the project folder.
4. Open the file by double-clicking it or by right-clicking and selecting **Open with Browser**.

No dependencies, servers, or additional configuration are required.

## Usage

* Open `resume.html` to view the resume.
* The resume includes the following sections:

  * About Me
  * Skills
  * Experience
  * Projects
  * Education
  * Contact Information

This project is intended for **learning and evaluation of semantic HTML**, not production deployment.

## Screenshots

Add screenshots inside a `screenshots/` folder and reference them here for evaluation.

```

## Notes

* Semantic tags such as `section`, `article`, `footer`, and `table` are used appropriately.
* Tables are used only for structured data.
* Styling is intentionally excluded to keep the focus on HTML fundamentals.
